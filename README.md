# ML_Urbansound8k_project

UrbanSound8K dataset containing 8732 labeled sound audios(≤ 4s).
In this project, we used the UrbanSound8K dataset containing 8732 labeled sound audios(≤ 4s). These audios come from 10 urban sound classes including air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engine idling, gun shot, jackhammer, siren, and street music. 
This dataset contains 10 classes: air\_conditioner, car\_horn, children\_playing, dog\_bark, drilling, engine\_idling, gun\_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street\_music.
Mel Spectrogram (MEL), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Short Time Fourier Transform (Chroma\_STFT), three of the most commonly used features extraction  in sound processing, are used.After feature extraction, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were used for classification.The results obtained from the models were compared and tested.the best result are obtained from the CNN model with the success of 56\% among the developed models.
